## What

While not my main notebook, I shall try to summarise here information upon I came across during my study for CISSP. 

The whole idea is to have it formatted in an optimal layout for [skimming](http://www.butte.edu/departments/cas/tipsheets/readingstrategies/skimming_scanning.html). **Accent is put on BREVITY.**


## Why?

**Because** many books have different ways of treating the subjects, starting with formatting (just letting text flow, with bold titles for the main ideas, which are nowhere grouped visually to show they belong together) and ending with definitions/notions which are available only in some books.

**Because** there are so many sources to learn from - books, video classes, Youtube videos, etc - and choosing one might be difficult for the newcomer.

**Because** nobody can tell (at least officially :)) HOW THE EXAM REALLY IS. This forces the students to learn (almost) all the details from the books (and there are many books to choose from!).

**Because** I stumbled upon [this](https://simonowens157.gitlab.io/cissp/){:target="_blank"} and liked the idea.

**Because** [insert here reason]

And last (but not least) - BECAUSE WHY NOT?!


## Can it be useful to me (the reader)?

Maybe. Maybe not. I dunno.

It helps me to organise the information in a visual way which makes it easier for me to quickly repeat/digest. Maybe you're more the video type or the "read the book" type. Then it won't work for you.
