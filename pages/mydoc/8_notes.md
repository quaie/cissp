# SDLC - systems development life cycle
- system development model
- in the context of CISSP --> secure systems development LC

- **prepare a sec plan**
- **initiation**
  - conduct a sensitivity assessment
- **dev/acquisition**
  - determine sec reqs
  - incorporate sec reqs in specifications
- **implementation**
  - install controls
  - sec testing
  - accreditation
- **operation/maintenance**
  - sec operations & administration
  - operational assurance
  - audits & monitoring
- **disposal**
  - destroy/archive info
  - media sanitization/destruction

# CASE - computer-aided software engineering
uses programs to assist  in the creation/maint of other programs

three types of CASE software:
- **tools** --> support only a specific task
- **workbench** --> integrate several tools in a single app
- **environment** --> collection of tools and workbenches

# Types of publicly released software

- **closed source** --> released in executable form, source code = confi
- **open source** --> source code = public
- **proprietary** --> subject to intellectual property protections

- **free software** --> free of charge (gratis) or free to modify it (libre)
- **freeware** --> free of charge to use
- **shareware** --> fully functional proprietary sw that can be used for free initially
- **crippleware** --> proprietary sw w/ key features disabled (pay for the full version)

# Application development models

**Waterfall model**
- linear, rigid phases; steps come in sequence, _**not possible to go back to the previous step**_
- _**modified waterfall**_ --> can return to previous phase for verif/validation

**Sashimi model**
- like waterfall, but with overlapping phases

**Agile**
- modern concepts, include Scrum & XP

**Scrum**
- team works as a unit: scrum team, scrum master, product owner

**XP - extreme programming**
- Agile dev method: pairs of programmers working together a detailed specification

**Spiral**
- designed to control risk
- repeats steps of a project, starting small, expanding outwards -- **rounds**
- each round --> is a project w/ own sw dev method
- risk analysis - each round

**RAD - Rapid Application Development**
- uses prototypes (dummy GUI, db, etc)
- goal = quickly meet the business needs, technical = secondary
- customer = heavily involved

```sh
CHANGE MGMT --> manage changes made to the systems (WHY) - formal review/approval from all stakeholders before implem
CONFIG MGMT --> record modifications to a prod environ (WHAT)
```

# Maturity models
to benchmark the software development maturity
- **CMMI - Capability Maturity Model Integration** --> defines 5 levels
  - _**initial**_ 
  - _**managed**_
  - _**defined**_
  - _**quantitatively managed**_
  - _**optimizing**_

- **SAMM - Software Assurange Maturity Model** --> open framework geared towards including sec features

- **BSIMM - Building Security in Maturity Model** --> measure the extent to which sec is included in software dev processes

- **AMM - Agile Maturity Model** --> sw process improvement model for Agile

# Integrated Product Team --> TBD
- customer-focused group that focuses on the entire lifecycle of a project
- multidisciplinary group, collectively responsible
- no strict hierarchy, involves ppl from various org structures

**software escrow** --> third party stores an archive of the software code

# Threat modeling
systematic & detailed analysis of all interfaces, API & interaction w/ components (db, OS) - try to understand the ways in which they could be misused/abused

**STRIDE** --> threat classif. model
- Spoofing of user identity
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Info disclosure
- DoS
- Elevation of privilege

# Acceptance testing


# Databases

**relational** --> two-dimensional tables (rows aka tuple + columns aka attributes)

**primary key** --> unique value in each row

**candidate key** --> any column w/ unique values

**foreign key** --> key that matches a primary key in another table

**DB integrity**
- _**referential**_ --> every foreign key matches a primary key
- _**semantic**_ --> each column value is consistent w/ the attribute data type
- _**entity**_ --> each row has a unique non-null primary key

**normalization** --> data is logically concise, organised & consistent; removes duplicates

**DB view** --> results of a query, used to provide a constrained user interface

**SDLC - systems development life cycle**

1. initiation/planning --> idea & objectives
2. func. req. definition --> how the functions will fit the users
3. system design specifications --> how data enters the system, flows and exits
4. dev & implem --> source code
5. docu & common program controls --> documentation, logging
6. acceptance --> tested by a third party (func & sec tests)
7. testing & evaluation controls --> guidelines how testing will be conducted
8. certification --> compared against set of standards to ensure it complies
9. accreditation --> mgmt approves system for implementation
10. implementation --> from dev to prod

_**additional in the larger SLC process:**_

11. operations & maintenance --> live prod, monitored & patched, etc
12. revisions & system replacement --> evaluate for new functionalities/retired
