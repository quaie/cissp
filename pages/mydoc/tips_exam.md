few mantras which will always be true:

- THINK LIKE A MANAGER !!!
- HUMAN LIFE IS ALWAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO PROTECT
- READY, AIM, FIRE before taking action
```

**DON'T TOUCH, ADVISE** --> like a consultant, focus on process, role, due diligence & due care

**COST vs VALUE** --> what would be gained (aka VALUE) by implementing the controls (aka COSTS)?

```sh
the most important question --> HOW, WHO, WHY, WHEN
```
