**clipping level** --> baseline threshold above which violations will be recorded

**geo-fecing** --> location factor authentication (type IV), devices only operate correctly within the geo-fence boundaries

**device authentication** --> relies on the identity of the device as part of the auth process (device is registered somewhere, is known)

### separation of duties 
- **dual control** --> 2/more users are req'd to perform the task
- **split knowledge** --> no single user has all the information to perform a task

**need to know** --> user/process is given only the minimum access privilege needed to perform a task

**least privilege** --> seeks to reduce access to a minimum (defined by "need to know")

**compartmentalization** --> users are divided into groups to facilitate the confinement of information to a single group/area

**default no access** --> add rights based on user's need to know and least privilege for his tasks

**scrubbing** --> delete incriminating data from an (audit) log
