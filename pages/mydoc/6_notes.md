# Assessment
--> determine how effectively the entity being evaluated meets specific sec criteria (assurance)

- **EXAMINATION**
  - passive, interview, review, inspect, study to understand/obtain evidence; NON INTRUSIVE
  - determine if documentation is proper, focus on policies/standards, etc.

- **TESTING**
  - active, do smth to compare actual/expected behaviors; INTRUSIVE
  - identify vulns, pentesting, password cracking, social engineering

E + T can be conducted:
- internal personnel
- external personnel
- overt --> known to affected personnel, cooperative
- covert --> adversarial, known to few people

T + E can be required contractual or regulated (GLBA, FISMA, PCI-DSS)

# ROE - Rules of Engagement
document that details the parameters/conduct of an assessment (test/examination)

components:
- scope --> selection of assessment objects (based on size, complexity, sampling)
  - sampling --> infer characteristics based on a sample; **evidence sampling** --> apply procedure to less than 100% of the population; **sampling risk**
  - sampling techniques
    - statistical sampling --> objective, each item has an equal probability of selection
    - non-statistical sampling --> subjective, included items are based on professional judgement
    - block sampling --> all items in a selected time period, numerical/alphabetical sequence
  - sampling approaches
    - fixed sample plan --> % of occurence in a defined population (how many)
    - stop and go sampling --> stop once a reasonable conclusion can be drawn
    - discovery/exploratory sampling --> single instance is enough (fraud, illegal activity)
- level of expertise/methodology
- logistics/comm plan
  - location (access to target - phy/logical)
  - timing (outside business, maint windows)
  - notification (internal, 3rd party, customers)
- data handling req
- reporting expectations
- assessor responsibilities
- legal considerations
  - authorization
  - liability
  - indemnification
  - non-disclosure
  - privacy

# Infrastructure assessment

- system config examination
- log review
- vuln assessment
- pentesting
- red team/blue team exercise --> simulated attack (preparedness/response capabilities)


**pentest types**
- black box (blind) --> pentester = no details, target knows
- double blind --> pentest = no details, target doesn't know; COVERT
- gray box --> pentest = limited knowledge, target knows
- white box (targeted) --> pentester + target work together; OVERT

**pentest phases**
- passive recon
- active recon
- attack planning
- attack & exploitation - depends on the RoE - proof of concept or actual exploit
- reporting --> vuln findings, exploit activities & recommendations (mitigation, etc)
- remediation & retesting

# Code Testing & Analysis

**Sec code assessment** --> examine/test source code to verify that proper sec controls are in place and function as intended.

- **tatic code analysis** --> static, read code
- **dynamic analysis** --> running code
- **fuzzing** --> automated; feed invalid, unexpected, random data
- **quality & performance testing** --> response to use & misuse
  - use case --> normal conditions
  - misuse case --> unexpected input, adverse conditions
  - load testing --> normal/peak conditions
  - volume testing --> incremental volume of records (not users)
  - stress testing --> abnormal number of users
  - synthetic transactions --> emulate a specific interaction to measure availability + response times
- **regression testing** --> functionality & security post-change (patch, update, config modif)


# Collect Security Process Data
security devices generate reports about their function

**IOA** - indicator of attack (attack is coming/already happeing)

**IOC** - indicator of compromise (already exploited)

**system custodian** --> cfg monitoring & respond to output, authorize & implement change

**security analyst** --> analyze activity & report errors

# Information Security Cont. Monitoring
program to maintain ongoing awareness of vulns/threats to support risk mgmt solutions; NIST SP800-137

maps to risk tolerance; involves management; adapts to ongoing needs

- define
- establish
- implement
- analyse/report
- respond
- review/update

ISCM needs the definition of:
- metrics --> standard of measurement
- freq of data collection
- implem tools & methodologies

**SCAP Security COntent Automation Protocol** --> enables automated vuln mgmt, measurement & policy compliance.

**NVD - National Vuln Database** --> US gov repo of vuln mgmg data in SCAP format


# Analyze Test Output & generate report

**test & operational data flow**

- collect output
- analyze data
- produce actionable intelligence:
  - operational metrics - vuln/threat/risk mgmt decisions
  - KPI - Key Performance Indicators, business metrics - _**measure progress towards meeting performance targets**_
  - Business Intelligence - supports allignment & long-term planning
    - data warehousing - combines data from various sources over time
    - data mining - looks for trends, patterns, anonalies
    - predictive analytics - attempt to predict smth based on past data
    - aggregation - summarization of data



# Conduct/facilitate security audits

**AUDIT** --> provides independent assurance based on evidence (examination + testing); auditors = professionals

audit types
- **internal controls audit** --> evaluation/verification of controls
- **compliance audit** --> comparison to established policies, standards
- **forensic audit** --> id fraudulent & criminal activity

**ENGAGEMENT LETTER** --> documents the audit plan (objective, scope, resources, target, reporting)

**AUDIT EVIDENCE** --> all info used by the audotor used to arrive to the conclusions

**audit examination report opinions**
- **unqualified opinion** --> no significant reservations
- **qualified opinion** --> minor deviations, scope limitations
- **adverse opinion** --> target is not compliant w/ control objectives or evidence = misleading

```sh
audit report is delivered to the highest level of management
```

**audit workflow**

- identify objective
- establish work paper documentation
- determine procedures
- collect/evaluate evidence
- analyse evidence & prepare report
- talk to mgmt
- present audit report

**infosec audit standards**
- COBIT
- ITAF
- **SSAE 18** --> report versions
  - **SOC 1** - financial report
  - **SOC 2** - controls to mitigate risks for sec, CIA & privacy (org chooses categories, but not audited controls)
  - **SOC 3** - same as SOC 2, designed for public distribution, less details
  - 2 types:
    - **type 1** - a certain point in time (04/04/2021); evaluation of design/implem, not efectiveness
    - **type 2** - design, implem & efectiveness over a period of time (6/12 months); includes tests of operational efectiveness & results


**compliance examinations**
- conducted by regulatory agencies, or on behalf of certification bodies
- reports may include opinions, findings, recomm, next steps
- failure --> fine, decertification, etc.
